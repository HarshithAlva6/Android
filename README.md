# Final Project and Presentation
 
# App Name: Util2go
  
# Project Description
* Login Page: Here we are also using Firebase as our database as well as for Authentication.
* Speech-to-Text: Once the User turns on the mike and speaks, the application will convert the speech to text and read it.  
* ImageToText: This app takes an image of the text, extracts the text from the image, and converts it into a PDF file.
* QR Scanner: Here the user can scan the QR-Code or the Barcode. We are using the Room Database to store all the scanned values of the QR-Code and Barcode. We can also add these values to the favorite list.
* Accelerometer: Here we can play with the device sensor. Based on the motion of the device the UI will display how much the device has moved from the ideal place. Ideal place of the device is when the phone is placed Horizontally.

A few Points to consider -
1. After cloning the app, build the app twice. This ensures the data in the backend is updated. Also replacing the image inside the res/drawable, i.e., text.png helps test multiple scenarios for ImageToText App.
